<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> **Periodically review your selected Identity Providers**. As previously mentioned,
Identity Providers must consistently meet the requirements for specific credential types in
order to maintain their certification. An agency should periodically review the list of
approved Identity Providers to ensure that their selected provider(s) remain on the
approved list and be informed as new Identity Providers become approved for use. This
step minimizes risk to a relying party application and may increase the availability of the
application to its external user population.

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> **Determine need for additional credential and profile types**. Application owners
seeking to use a credential type that has not been assessed or for which a credential
profile has not been created, the Federal ICAM Initiative can create a scheme profile and
begin assessing Identity Providers against the profile.

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> **Consider all Identity Providers for a particular credential type**. An agency should
consider all Identity Providers that may be viable for their target user population, as
different Identity Providers may be more suitable for specific groups or individuals
within the user population. It is unnecessary to integrate with all applicable Identity
Providers in cases where it would create undue burden; however, enabling multiple
Identity Providers provides a greater selection for customers.
