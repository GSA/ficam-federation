-------------------------------------------------------

There are some additional design characteristics that an agency should consider when designing their federation system. This additional considerations include:

**Defining access control requirements**
<br>

An agency should define specific access control requirements related to granting access to users external to the Federal Government by determining what levels of access are needed and employing robust access control models to provide a more granular level of control over user access privileges. Verifying the user’s access need occurs in addition to the identity proofing process performed by the Identity Provider. 
<br>

**Determining an identity lifecycle management process for non-federal users**
<br>

In order to establish a user account for a non-federal user, an identity record will need to be created for them as part of the provisioning process. An agency has existing digital identity life cycle management processes in place for its internal users; however, this process may need to be expanded or modified to include a non-federal user population. Records for non-federal users may contain a different set of identity attributes, but they must be managed in a way that is consistent with existing agency requirements and processes.

**Working with application owners to understand additional needs**
<br>

In addition to leveraging the existing government-wide frameworks and standards provided through the TFPAP and Identity Scheme Adoption Process, an agency should work with its application and system owners to determine if additional profiles and schemes are required to support specific mission or business needs and communicate those needs through the appropriate review and approval channels.
<br>

**Incorporating into the IT change management process** 
<br>

Accepting trusted non-federally issued credentials may require changes to an agency’s IT application. When planning to enable an application to federate with external parties an agency should evaluate any necessary procedural or technical changes through their established change management processes.
