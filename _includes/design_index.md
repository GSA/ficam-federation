# Design Your Federation
--------------------------------------

The elements required to implement federation varies from one agency to another. Choosing the correct approach to accepting third-party credentials is highly dependent on the number/type of applications and infrastructure that an agency currently has in place. This section provides guidance for an RP as it prepares to implement a solution architecture that best fits the agency/RP needs in order to accept third-party credentials. The topics in this section include: 
<br>

* [Evaluate Existing Infrastructure and Services.](../1_infrastructure/) 
<br>

This section discusses the possible states of an agency’s ICAM infrastructure and how the infrastructure and services can be leveraged to provide a basis for federation.
<br>

* [Select and Develop the Optimal Solution Architecture.](../2_solution-arch)
<br>

This section details three reference architectures that can be used when accepting third-party credentials. It also provides a list of considerations around each approach.
<br>


* [Select a Federation Topology.](../4_add-design)

This section discusses three topologies that can be used based the Relying Party’s relationship with their external partner.
