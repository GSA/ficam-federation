# Plan Your Federation
--------------------------------------------

Understanding the benefits and drivers for accepting third-party credentials and successfully leveraging the Trust Framework Solutions Program provides the necessary foundation for an RP to begin its planning period. The planning period is used to build a business case and gather relevant details for the applications being updated to accept third-party credentials. This section provides clarification around planning considerations and best practices to help the RP implement a solution to accept third-party credentials. This section includes:

[Identify Business Considerations](../1_considerations/)
<br>

This section provides guidance for an RP to create a business case that takes into account which of the agencyâ€™s applications are required or may benefit from modification to accept third-party credentials and the associated cost of doing so. 
<br>
	
[Understand the RP Environment](../2_environment/)

This section provides guidance for an RP to understand details about its application through reviewing and conducting various assessments. 
<br>
	
[Determine Applicability to Security and Privacy Controls](../3_applicability)
<br>

This section provides guidance on the security and privacy controls for an RP application that are affected by implementing a federation solution.
<br>
	
[Determine Acceptable Credentials](../4_credentials)
<br>

This section provides guidance to an RP on what to consider when deciding which third-party credentials to accept for access.
<br>

[Partner with an Identity Provider(s)](../5_partner)
<br>

This section provides guidance to an RP about establishing a partnership with one or more FICAM-approved Identity Providers that will support the RP's credentials type(s).

The considerations discussed within this section are for operational, externally-facing applications. Therefore, the applications should have existing assessments completed that can be referenced as a starting point for understanding the RP environment. Once the RP has completed the planning activities described in this section, the RP will have enough information to select a solution architecture and begin implementation.
