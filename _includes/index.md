# Federation Programmatic Playbook
----------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to the Federation Programmatic Playbook, where you will find information to support general knowledge around the topic of federation, as well as guidance to support your planning and design efforts for identity and credential federation implementation. This playbook is intended for ICAM Program Managers and other business owners who may be looking to understand the topic of Federation better and various planning and design items they should consider before beginning solution design and implementation. This playbook also contains guidance for implementers and engineers who are looking for guidance around the technical implementation of federation at their agencies.

The content in this guide heavily leverages and replaces guidance that existed in Chapter 8 of the FICAM Roadmap and Implementation Guide v2.0 and the Relying Party Guidance, developed by the ICAMSC in 2011 and the ICAMSC Federation Interoperability Working Group (FIWG) in 2013, respectively.

**What is Federation?**
<br>

The FICAM Architecture defines Federation as “the ability of one organization to accept another organization’s work”. [The FICAM Architecture](http://gsa.github.io/ficam-arch/services/federation/) defines four federation services in the Services Framework: Attribute Exchange, Credential Translation, Credential Bridging, and Policy Alignment. 

For additional context and a more educational description of Federation and ICAM, please visit the [Overview of Federation section](../federation/overview/index/) of this playbook. This overview includes information about implementation models, an explanation of the Federal Trust Framework, and information on federation governance. 

<br>

**What should I consider when planning to federate?**
<br>

Planning for federation requires several actions, including identifying business considerations, understanding the Relying Party environment, determining applicability to security and privacy controls, determining acceptable credentials, and partnering with one or more Identity Providers. You will find more information on each of these topics in the [Plan Your Federation section.](../federation/plan/index/)

<br>

**What should I consider when designing my federation services?**
<br>

There are several considerations for designing federation services, including evaluating your existing infrastructure and services, developing a solution architecture, and selecting the optimal architecture solution to fit your needs. Information of these and other design considerations can be found in the [Design Your Federation section.](../federation/design/index/)

<br>

**Where would I find Federation use case examples?**)
<br>

The [FICAM Architecture](http:///gsa.github.io/ficam-arch/services/federation/) currently defines two graphical, high-level use cases for federation services:
<br>

* [Exchange attributes in a Federation](http://gsa.github.io/ficam-arch/usecases/41_federate_exchange_attributes/) 
* [Accept Credentials in a Federation](http://gsa.github.io/ficam-arch/usecases/42_federate_accept/)

<br>

**How do I implement federation services?**
<br>

Some initial information about federation implementation can be found in the [Implement Your Federation section](../federation/implement/index/), including guidance on Credential Service Provider integration and account management. [The Credential Service Provider integration](../federation/implement/1_csp-integrate/) section includes information on selecting a Credential Service Provider, establishing trust in a federation, and user interface. The [Account Management](../federation/implement/2_acct-mgmt/) section includes information regarding account management scenarios and patterns, account linking, and account maintenance.

This playbook will be periodically updated to provide additional information based on your feedback and to include any changes in policy related to government-wide federation.
