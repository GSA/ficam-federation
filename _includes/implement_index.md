# Implement Your Federation
---------------------
Once an RP has selected its federation architecture, it can begin implementation of the technology solution. Two of the main elements of implementation are integrating the CSP and successful linking to an RP account. This section provides guidance on these elements in the following sections: 
<br>

[CSP Integration](../1_csp-integrate/)
<br>

This section provides the RP with considerations for selecting the correct CSP, exchanging information with the CSP to achieve programmed trust, and updating the user interface to allow a user to access the application with his/her third-party credential.
<br>

[Account Management](../2_acct-mgmt/)
<br>

This section discusses the process of creating and managing accounts for external users (i.e., non-federal users that leverage third-party credentials to gain access to federal applications). Additionally this section provides account management scenarios and examples, describes the account linking processes, and necessary maintenance activities.
