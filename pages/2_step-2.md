A successful federation implementation is one that takes an agency’s mission and business needs into consideration and supports an agency’s processes for interfacing with its customers. When there are many externally facing applications, the cost savings are amplified, thereby increasing the benefits of accepting of third-party credentials. The RP can use this information to strengthen its business case and gain leadership approval. To build the business case, the RP will need to document the costs and benefits of accepting third-party credentials. This can be accomplished by taking the following steps:

## <span style="color: #0C5C89">**Checklist**</span>

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Estimate upfront cost of implementation.** The number of applications that require the acceptance of third-party credentials will dictate the solution architecture that should be used. This will in turn determine what existing infrastructure can be reused, the new infrastructure that needs to be put in place, and the cost of implementation and maintenance. 

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Estimate application integration costs.** The cost should be calculated based on the integration effort per application. The application integration effort will depend on the complexity of the application, how easily its authentication method can be modified, and the ability to link third-party credentials to RP accounts. 

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Estimate ongoing costs.** In addition to the implementation cost, other life cycle costs should also be considered including management, governance, operations, and maintenance of the system. If a shared service provider is used, such as a federation broker, then the RP should also account for ongoing service charges. 

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Estimate benefits.** After the costs are known, the benefits and return on investment (ROI) can be calculated for the reduction of the need to identity proof and manage credentials. 

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Create a phased approach.** A phased and prioritized approach should be used to split activities into achievable milestones and demonstrate incremental benefits. One of these phases should include communicating changes to stakeholders and users, since accepting externally issued credentials for access to government resources signals a paradigm shift for agencies and users that have traditionally relied on federally-issued credentials.
