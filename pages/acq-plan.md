When planning for the acquisition of products and services for its ICAM program, an agency must comply with specified regulations and policies, the main system of regulations being the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). The FAR sets for the rules governing the federal acquisition process and includes several clauses specificially relevant to an agency's ICAM program. 

Using the resources discussed in this section offers an agency the following benefits when purchasing products and services to support its ICAM program:

*  **More competitive rates and potentially lower costs**

	Regardless of the method used to access Schedules 70 and 84, GSA has already negotiated fair and reasonable prices for these products and services.

*  **Shorter procurement time**

	GSA Schedules offer streamlined procurement over agency-negotiated contracts, which can be cumbersome and costly. Additionally, tools such as eBuy and GSA Advantage are available to assist in ordering from both Schedules.

*  **Reduced complexity and effort required to perform due dilligence**

	Agencies purchasing products not included on the GSA APL are responsible for ensuring that the products and services procured meet all applicable federal standards and requirements, ensuring conformance to applicable federal standards for the life cycle of the components, and maintaining a written plan for ensuring ongoing conformance to applicable federal standards for the life cycle of the components.
	
*  **Elimination of non-compliance with standards and requirements**

	If the GSA Schedules and the APL are not used, an agency also runs the risk of potential non-compliance if its conformance processes are incomplete or do not keep pace with changes within the GSA Evaluation Program.

When purchasing products and services for its HSPD-12 implementation, an agency must also follow OMB M-06-18 and leverage the Federal Information Processing Standards 201 (FIPS 201) Evaluation Program Approved Products List (APL). In addition to the requirements governing federal acquisitions, an agency has other resources at its disposal to support acquisition for its ICAM program, including the GSA Schedules.



| What is the difference between General Services Administation (GSA) Schedules and the Approved Products List (APL)?                                           |
|-----------------------------------------------|
| GSA Schedules are purchasing vehicles for a broad range of products and services. The resources available on the GSA Schedules have pre-approved vendors and pre- negotiated rates. The APL is a list of Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12) related products and services that have been tested per an approved National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) test procedure. An agency can use the GSA Schedules to purchase a resource that is included on the APL. |


M-06-18 provides guidance to federal agencies related  to the acquisition of products and services for HSPD-12 implementations. It introduced several amendments to the FAR, which were codified in 48 C.F.R Subpart 4.13, that require an agency to comply with HSPD-12 and FIPS 201 for contractors who require routine logical or physical access and include language to this effect in applicable solicitations and contracts.

The addition to the FAR also requires that agencies purchase only approved products and services in support of their HSPD-12 implementations. The FIPS 201 Evaluation Program was developed to organize and define a standard approval process for these products and services. All required NIST validation and GSA testing must be met to be an approved product or service for HSPD-12 purchases. Approved products and services, which have been demonstrated to meet NIST validation and GSA testing and have been qualified by the Evaluation Program, can be found on the FIPS 201 APL.

| Agencies are strongly encouraged to institute processes to include language in solicitations and contracts, where applicable, requiring use of the PIV card where encryption and digital signature services are provided. This language would supplement the existing FAR requirements related to using the PIV card for contractor access. This approach not only promotes government-wide consistency in providing these security services, but also supports a greater return on investment (ROI) in leveraging the agency’s existing PIV infrastructure. |


The APL is continuously updated to reflect new products and technologies that have been assessed and approved. It is an agency‘s responsibility to stay current on these changes and incorporate them into agency planning during regular technology refresh cycles as part of the capital planning and budget process. A complete inventory of Government Certified and Approved Services and Products Listings, including the FIPS 201 APL, Certified PKI (public key infrastructure) Shared Service Providers (SSP) List, and Qualified HSPD-12 Service Providers List, can be found on GSA‘s website.

In addition to the APL, there are several other activities underway in the Federal ICAM Initiative to identify and recognize specific categories of products and services that meet advertised criteria to support other functions within an agency‘s ICAM program. These include:

*  **The Path Discovery and Validation (PDVAL) products approval process** using the Public Key Interoperability Test Suite (PKITS) to ensure compatibility and interoperability of solutions within the Federal Bridge Certification Authority (FBCA)

*  **The Trust Framework Provider Adoption Process (TFPAP)**, which outlines the process that the ICAM community uses to certify organizations that assess commercial Identity Providers for use by the Federal Government

*  **The Personal Identity Verification Interoperability (PIV-I)** for Non-Federal Issuers (NFI) guidance and supporting processes for approving an NFI


| <center> Implementation Tip </center> |
|---------------------------------------|
|Purchasing products off of the Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12) Approved Products List (APL) does not ensure interoperability or appropriateness for your agency’s implementation. Products bought from the APL must be properly integrated and configured to be interoperable with other ICAM programs and services. Furthermore, prior to acquiring, agencies should determine if the products are appropriate for the risk level and/or design of the ICAM solution.                                   |


Though not a required acquisition tool, GSA Schedules provide quick, flexible, cost-effective procurement solutions and assist in compliance by including approved products. There are two GSA schedules that are relevant to the ICAM effort:

*  **IT Schedule 70**
*  **IT Schedule 84**

###IT Schedule 70
IT Schedule 70 is under the Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program and gives agencies direct access to commercial experts who are able to address the needs of the government IT Community through a series of Sppecial Item Number (SINs). These SINs cover most of the general purpose commercial IT hardware, software, and services and should be used by agencies as needed to meet their mission objectives as well as ICAM initiatives. 

Within IT Schedule 70, GSA has set up SINs 132-60 through 132-62, which can help an agency meet the procurement needs of its ICAM program, including electronic credentials, PKI services, and HSPD-12 products and services. With regard to HSPD-12, M-06-18 promotes the use of IT Schedule 70, SIN 132-62 and notes that agencies purchasing HSPD-12 products and services through acquisition vehicles other than GSA IT Schedule 70 bear the responsibility for ensuring that they comply with the applicable federal standards and requirements.

### IT Schedule 84
In addition to IT Schedule 70, ICAM implemenetations often require acquistion of security products and services, particularly items related to Physical Access Control Systems (PACS). These items may be procured using Schedule 84, which includes a full suite of solutions for law enforcement, security, facilities management, fire, rescue, clothing, marine craft, and emergency/disaster response.

Agency procurement personnel may purchase resources off of both schedules to meet their ICAM implementation needs. For example, an agency trying to modernize their PACS could purchase new PIV card readers for access control points off of Schedule 84 and purchase services from the system integrator off of Schedule 70.


| Why are some products and services not represented by a category on the FIPS 201 Product/Service category list? |
|-----------------------------------------------|
| The FIPS 201 Evaluation Program assesses and approves only products and services for which there are direct requirements specified in FIPS 201. Although they are not part of the Evaluation Program, GSA has also developed qualification requirements and a list of qualified vendor services for other products and services that may be necessary for Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12) systems and deployments but have no direct requirements in FIPS 201 (e.g., integration services, contractor managed services and solutions).
