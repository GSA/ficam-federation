Once an agency has selected appropriate credential(s), it then needs to establish a relationship with one or more Identity Providers capable of supporting the selected credential type(s). Identity Providers that have been certified by approved TFPs have policies and practices comparable to ICAM trust requirements established for one or more adopted Scheme Profiles. This certification and approval process helps ensure trust and interoperability for an agency relying party. If the certification process is successful, then the Identity Provider is added to a list of approved providers. Approved Identity Providers must continue to meet the requirements in order to maintain their certification.

When selecting one or more Identity Providers with which to interact, an agency should consider the following: 

> * The list of approved identity providers offers protection 

> * Periodically review your selected Identity Providers 

> * Determine need for additional credential and profile types 

> * Consider all Identity Providers for a particular credential type 

External Identity Providers are assessed and certified by the approved TFPs. Agencies should refer to the TFS Programâ€™s approved <a href="https://www.idmanagement.gov/IDM/IDMFicamProductSearchPage" target="_blank"> Identity Services Provider List</a> for an up-to-date list of approved Identity Providers.
