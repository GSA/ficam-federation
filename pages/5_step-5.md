One of the first steps that an agency should take to enable the use of trusted third-party credentials is determining what types of credentials are acceptable for access. This is a multi-step process that involves careful consideration of a number of factors associated with the application’s business, security, infrastructure requirements, and the target user population.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Determine LOA and Security and Privacy Requirements.** Review the application’s level of assurance and analyze the specific security and technology requirements and infrastructure limitations.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Identify Credential Requirements.** Based on the application’s level of assurance, review the list of approved credential schemes that meet the security, privacy, and technology requirements. The application’s level of assurance dictates minimally acceptable credential types. Agencies should refer to guidance posted on the Federal Government’s Identity Management homepage for a current list of approved credentials

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Analyze User Population.** Analyze the target user population to determine what credentials are available or can easily be obtained. When analyzing the user population, consider the following:

>> * Credentials that users external to the Federal Government already have 

>> * Total number of external users 

>> * User information requirements 

>> * Ability of user to complete credential enrollment/issuance steps

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Select Acceptable Credentials.** An agency should select acceptable credentials that meet level of assurance, security, and privacy requirements and are available to the target user population.
