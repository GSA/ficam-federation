# Homeland Security Information Network

## The Challenge

Effective information sharing is critically dependent on efficient interoperability and requires robust security approaches that ensure the safeguarding and validity of data passed between systems. The Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Janet Napolitano, stated that “Information sharing between DHS and State governments is particularly critical to our security. Information sharing is also what makes response efforts effective. The creation of a seamless network we can use to share this information among these levels of government is a critical part of improving our partnerships.”60 In an effort to increase collaboration and information sharing, several operational challenges were identified. These include:

- The proliferation of Communities of Interests (COI) operating in silos that had pertinent information;
- The lack of a trust mechanism to ensure the security and validity of the information provided by the COIs;
- The countless number of DHS portals necessary for access to COIs;
- The multiple DHS partner components targeting the same user base; and
- The increase of COIs to address separation of information sharing and established silos of content.

## The Solution

To solve this challenge, DHS implemented the Homeland Security Information Network (HSIN), a web-based, unclassified information sharing platform supporting federal and non-federal partners to establish awareness, collaborate and share information. In attempting to connect the various COIs, the first two releases of HSIN identified the following needs:

- SSO across the entire HSIN program;
- SSO federated across multiple HSIN and DHS organizations;
- Strong network of Trusted Identities across a large and diverse set of Stakeholders;
- Secure and protect user identities, system access, and information resources;
- Efficient access control for information resources;
- Fast response time to changing relationships; and
- Adopt a complete, integrated, modular approach to manage users and control resource access.

HSIN provides DHS the mechanism necessary to fight against terrorism, secure nations, enforce immigration laws, and respond to natural disasters. Over the past five years, HSIN has grown from a system deployed in two states and the District of Columbia to a system deployed in all 50 states, with more than 40 fusion centers, 53 major urban areas, five U.S. territories and several international partners. The current release of HSIN, HSIN Release 3 (R3), is an information sharing model that put the network in the position to evolve from a “need to know” to “responsibility to provide” environment. R3 replaces the first two iterations of HSIN, HSIN Legacy and HSIN NextGen respectively.
R3 provides the program with a more comprehensive identity and access management solution to uniquely identify a user, manage his/her credentials, eliminate redundant identities, reuse credentials, and establish a foundation of trust and interoperability within the HSIN program and external partners.
