Assigning performance measurements to an agency‘s ICAM program provides decision makers and stakeholders with a useful tool to monitor progress, determine program effectiveness, and identify areas that need more funding or process improvement.

|---------------------------------------|
| It is important to make leadership and management feel ownership and accountability for the success of their agency’s ICAM program. One way to accomplish this is to tie any outcomes and accomplishments of the ICAM program specifically to the responsible individual’s yearly performance plan.                  |

Performance reporting for ICAM programs has traditionally been focused on external reporting requirements (e.g., OMB HSPD-12 implementation status reports). In addition to mandatory reporting requirements, agencies should determine ways to leverage performance reporting to improve alignment with the ICAM segment architecture and drive progress on ICAM programs internal to the agency. 

The ICAM Architecture specifies 32 performance metrics that align with achieving the ICAM target state. These serve as a starting point for agencies to measure the performance of their ICAM program and report the results to executive leadership. It is recommended that agencies incorporate the ICAM metrics into their ICAM program management practices and project reporting practices. Additionally, agencies should incorporate relevant metrics into their Exhibit 300 business case submissions for any ICAM investments as a means of tracking pertinent information and demonstrating investment results and value to the agency.

At the end of FY 2010, agencies were required to complete their plans for implementing the use of the PIV credential within the agency and an ICAM Reporting Template was provided for this purpose (available on [www.max.omb.gov](https://max.gov/maxportal/home.action)). In addition, there is mandatory reporting via the Cyberscope process for agency use of PIV credentials for physical and logical access.
