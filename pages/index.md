### What is the Federation Programmatic Playbook? 

Identity federation, commonly referred to as federation, is a term used to describe the technology, standards, policies, and processes that allow an organization to trust digital identities, identity attributes, and credentials created and issued by another organization. Federation allows an agency to provide modernized logical access control services for users, by trusting and accepting credentials that those users already have. This can allow non-federal users to access an agencyâ€™s resources while minimizing and potentially eliminating the need to redundantly collect and manage identity information and credentials.

This playbook is intended for ICAM Program Managers and other business owners who may be looking to understand the topic of Federation better and various planning and design items they should consider before beginning solution design and implementation. This playbook also contains guidance for implementers and engineers who are looking for guidance around the technical implementation of federation at their agencies.

### How is the playbook structured?

We developed this playbook into 10 individual steps, or activities. Within each step, you will find a checklist to help you perform that activity and additional guidance, like frequently asked questions (FAQs), implementation tips, or security and privacy considerations.

### How was the playbook developed?

This playbook was created using updated and migrated content that previously was found in the FICAM Roadmap and Implementation Guidance v2.0. We hope that the new format encourages you and your agency to contribute to additional content to support the access control management across the Federal government.

### Where can I find additional content?

The FICAM Architecture provides a high-level overview of identity management and a description of the services that deliver access management capabilities. We recommend that you visit the <a href="http://gsa.github.io/ficam-arch/" target="_blank"> FICAM Architecture</a> site to gain a basic understanding of access management and its role in broader federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM).


### How can I contribute to this playbook?

We look forward to your use and contribution to this playbook. Please visit our  <a href="http://bnbuckler.github.io/ficam-federation/contribute/" target =" _blank"> Contribute page </a> to learn how to post questions and contribute content.
