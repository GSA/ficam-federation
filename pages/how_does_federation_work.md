title: How Does Federation Work
permalink: /how_does_federation_work/

Federation is made possible through the establishment and use of common exchange protocols
and agreed-upon open standards/specifications that allow an agency to authenticate a user from
another organization or trust an authentication conducted outside of the agency. The use of these
common rules enables an agency to place a level of trust in the federated identity and credential
to which that identity is bound. Given the nature of federated transactions and the electronic
exchange of identity data across organizational boundaries, there is an increased focus on
security and privacy to ensure users‘ sensitive identity data is appropriately safeguarded.

In a federated environment, these transactions occur between trusted Identity Providers that have
been approved through the Federal Trust Framework and relying parties. Identity Providers are
service providers that create, maintain, and manage identity information and credentials for
users, in accordance with one of the four levels of assurance.266 Relying parties are entities that
receive and consume identity and credential data from Identity Providers and make access
control decisions based on that data, in accordance with the Federal Trust Framework and
established federation governance. Section 12.2 provides a more detailed overview of the Federal
Trust Framework, which exists to provide a foundational level of trust between relying parties
and approved Identity Providers. Additionally, Section 12.4.2 provides guidance to help agencies
select Identity Providers and credentials that have been approved through the Federal Trust
Framework.

The information presented in this section is intended to assist agencies in providing answers to
several common questions, including:
1. Why should my agency trust identity data and credentials that we did not create and
issue?
2. What benefits can my agency expect to see from trusting and accepting another
organization‘s credentials?
3. How can my agency connect with our external business partners and are there common
approaches that can be used?

While federation agreements will vary based on agency requirements, laws, and policies, the Identity, Credential and Access Management Subcommittee (ICAMSC) has developed a Federation Agreement Checklist to serve as a starting point for agencies to use when developing federation agreements for information/attribute sharing.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Establish member responsibilities.** Federation governance should detail the procedural process participants must follow in order to become and remain members in the federation. Some examples of what should be covered in regards to membership responsibilities include the application and approval process, how suspensions and revocations are handled, the fees and costs for being a federation member, how disputes will be resolved, and proactively taking steps to raise risks as they appear. 

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Create a governance board.** Federation governance should define the membership and roles and responsibilities of the Governance Board. This is the executive-level body with representation from primary stakeholders that guides the federation and is the final body to make decisions for the federation. This group is typically responsible for approval of any modifications and/or recommendations to guidelines, standards, or documents of the federation, as well as management and resolution of risks. 

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Define the responsibilities of Federation Management.** Federation governance should define the membership and roles and responsibilities of the Federation Management. This body manages the day-to-day operations of the federation. Some responsibilities may include developing policies and guidelines, implementing approval processes, reviewing membership conformance, ensuring validity of federation documents (e.g., legal agreements/contracts), facilitating the roles, relationships and mutual obligations of all parties operating in the federation, and providing administrative support for the Governance Board. 

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Define the responsibilities of Identity Providers.** Federation governance should define the membership and roles and responsibilities of the Identity Providers. Identity Providers create, maintain, and manage accurate, reliable and current identity information for end users in accordance with their published procedures. Some responsibilities may include performing end user authentication and supplying the authenticated user information to relying parties, maintaining a direct relationship with end users, and communicating and implementing relevant federation rules into their agreements with end users. 

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Define the responsibilities of Relying Parties.** Federation governance should define the membership and roles and responsibilities of the relying parties. Relying parties supply electronic information services to users registered with an Identity Provider.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Define server requirements.** Federation governance should describe the technical requirements related to how the servers are configured, on-boarded, audited, and checked for quality. 

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Establish Security and Privacy requirements.** Federation governance should describe the technical requirements for how security will be maintained within the federation. Some examples include the protections for personally identifiable data collected and maintained by the federation, personnel security processes for federation administrative staff, physical security for sites hosting federation services, and processes and tools used to detect failures and intrusion attempts and to mediate and recover from intrusions. 

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Define Integration and Testing requirements.** Federation governance should describe the requirements for integrating and testing the technology that impacts the federation, such as identity management provisioning systems, authentication servers, user log-on client software, commercial products, schemes or protocols, applications that consume credentials, and auditing, alerting and logging infrastructure.
