- What are the considerations for user interface design/implementation.
- Section 10 Usability Considerations of NIST SP 800-63C

From the usability perspective, one of the major potential benefits of federated identity systems is to address the problem of user fatigue associated with managing multiple authenticators. While this has historically been a problem with usernames and passwords, the increasing need for users to manage many authenticators — whether physical or digital — presents a usability challenge.

The overall user experience with federated identity systems should be as smooth and easy as possible. This can be accomplished by following usability standards (such as the ISO 25060 series of standards) and established best practices for user interaction design.

Federated identity systems should:

- Minimize user burden (e.g., frustration, learning curve)
- Minimize the number of user actions required.
- Allow users to quickly and easily select among multiple accounts with a single IdP. For example, approaches such as Account Chooser allow users to select from a list of accounts they have accessed in the recent past, rather than start the federation process by selecting their IdP from a list of potential IdPs.
- Balance minimizing user burden with the need to provide sufficient information to enable users to make informed decisions.
- Minimize the use of unfamiliar technical jargon and details (e.g., users do not need to know the terms IdP and RP if the basic concepts are clearly explained).
- Strive for a consistent and integrated user experience across the IdP and RP.
- Help users establish an understanding of identity by providing resources to users such as graphics, illustrations, FAQs, tutorials and examples. Resources should explain how users’ information is treated and how transacting parties (e.g., RPs, IdPs, and brokers) relate to each other.
- Provide clear, honest, and meaningful communications to users (i.e., communications should be explicit and easy to understand).
- Provide users online services independent of location and device.
- Make trust relationships explicit to users to facilitate informed trust decisions. Trust relationships are often dynamic and context dependent. Users may be more likely to trust some IdPs and RPs with certain attributes or transactions more than others. For example, users may be more hesitant to use federated identity systems on websites that contain valuable personal information (such as financial or health). Depending on the perceived sensitivity of users’ personal data, users may be less comfortable with social network providers as IdPs since people are often concerned with the broadcasting nature of social networking implementations.
- Follow the usability considerations specified in SP 800-63A, Section 9 for any user-facing information.
- Clearly communicate how and where to acquire technical assistance. For example, provide users with information such as a link to an online self-service feature, chat sessions or a phone number for help desk support. Avoid redirecting users back and forth among transacting parties (e.g., RPs, IdPs, and brokers) to receive technical assistance.
- Perform integrative and continuous usability evaluations with representative users and realistic tasks in an appropriate context to ensure success of federated identity systems from the users’ perspectives.
