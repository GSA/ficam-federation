---------------------------------------------

A key facet of federation is the ability of an agency to reliably accept the identity of users from outside of the organization and ensure the trustworthiness of third-party credentials. To support this effort, the Federal ICAM Initiative has put significant work into creating a government-wide framework to enable trust in federated environments. This framework includes parallel efforts and mechanisms for establishing the trust necessary to support federation for the Federal Government based on the credential type, namely: 

* **Trust Framework Solutions (TFS) Program.** The FICAM Trust Framework Solutions (TFS) is the federated identity framework for the U.S. federal government. It includes guidance, processes and supporting infrastructure to enable secure and streamlined citizen and business facing online service delivery. The main components of the TFS Initiative are: 
<br>

	* **The Trust Framework Provider Adoption Process (TFPAP) for All Levels of Assurance.** A process for assessing the efficacy of industry-based trust frameworks to enable an agency to trust an externally-issued electronic identity credential at a known level of assurance comparable to the levels of assurance. The scope of the TFPAP is limited to externally-issued credentials comparable to LOA 1, 2, and 3 (non-PKI). 
	<br>
	
	* **Authority to Offer Services (ATOS) for FICAM TFS Approved Identity Services.** A process for establishing a direct relationship between identity service providers and the Federal Government.
	<br>
	
	* **The Identity Scheme and Protocol Profile Adoption Process.** A process for assessing the efficacy of schemes (i.e., specific subsets of identity management standards) to enable their use by an agency in a manner that is secure, technically interoperable, and reliable at a known level of assurance comparable to one of the four levels of assurance, as defined in SP 800-63. 
	<br>
	
* **Federal PKI.** The Federal PKI (FPKI) provides a common, government-wide infrastructure (e.g., policies, processes, server platforms, software, and workstations) for the purpose of administering digital certificates and public-private key pairs, including the ability to issue, maintain, and revoke public key certificates.

It is important to note that the TFS Program recognizes FPKI credentials in the same way the program recognizes other credentials, though the process and governance structures of PKI and non-PKI credentials are different.
