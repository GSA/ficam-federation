One of the first steps that an agency should take to enable the use of trusted third-party credentials is determining what types of credentials are acceptable for access. This is a multi-step process that involves careful consideration of a number of factors associated with the application’s business, security, infrastructure requirements, and the target user population. The figure below provides a high-level description of this process that agencies should seek to use and adapt to meet their specific mission and business needs.

<br>

| <center> Process Step </center> | <center> Description </center> | <center> Key Considerations </center> |
|----------------------------|
| **Step 1: Determine LOA and Security and Privacy Requirements** | Review the application’s level of assurance and analyze the specific security and technology requirements and infrastructure limitations. | •	Each application’s level of assurance is defined in accordance with [M-04-04](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/fy04/m04-04.pdf) <br><br> • GSA provides the eAuthentication Risk and Requirements Assessment (e-RA) to assist in determining level of assurance <br><br> • Application-specific security and privacy requirements should be documented in the system security plan |
| **Step 2: Identify Credential Requirements** | Based on the application’s level of assurance, review the list of approved credential schemes that meet the security, privacy, and technology requirements. | • The application’s level of assurance dictates minimally acceptable credential types <br><br> • Additional, enhanced security controls may impact credential selection <br><br> •	Agencies should refer to guidance posted on the Federal Government’s Identity Management homepage for a current list of approved credentials |
| **Step 3: Analyze User Population** | Analyze the target user population to determine what credentials are available or can easily be obtained that meet the requirements identified in Steps 1 and 2. | • Determine what external credentials the target user population already has <br><br> • Determine if additional credential types could be easily obtained <br><br> • Determine need to support additional credential types in the future <br><br> • Analyze potential shifts in the target user population that could affect credential types |
| **Step 4: Select Acceptable Credentials** | Select acceptable credentials that meet the criteria established in Steps 1 and 2 and are appropriate based on the user population analysis conducted in Step 3. | • An agency should select acceptable credentials that meet level of assurance, security, and privacy requirements and are available to the target user population |

<br>

One of the key requirements that an agency should look to when determining which third-party credentials to accept is the application’s level of assurance. Refer to IDManagement.gov for more information on levels of assurance and an up-to-date list of adopted schemes. 

In addition to identifying what credentials meet the application’s level of assurance, an agency should determine what credentials are appropriate for the target user population. An agency can determine this by performing an analysis of the target user population. This analysis provides an agency with sufficient information about its external users to narrow down the list of minimally acceptable credentials to those that are feasible for implementation. When conducting a user population analysis, an agency should consider the following:

* Credentials that users external to the Federal Government already have 
<br>

* Total number of external users
<br>

* User information requirements
<br>

* Ability of user to complete credential enrollment/issuance steps
