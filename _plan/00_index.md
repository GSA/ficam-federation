- Audience: Program Managers (single coordination points for managing operations)
- Define the project management steps for planning a Federation project 
- Intro to the Plan section - review, modify and apply plain language principles including less words / more actionable items; focus on steps for a program manager to plan for a single sign on or federated sign on model for a federal enterprise or a federal mission application
- Relying Party Doc Section 5.1 (Page 21) has some materials for this planning.
- (2/5/2018) Possible Single Sign-on Referenced Document: _Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management Trust Framework Solutions Functional Requirements for FICAM SAML 2.0 Web Browser SSO Profile v1.0.2_ (Version 1.0.0) (date: 3/11/2014?) (doc undated)

===============================

Itâ€™s true that federation is a real change in the way things have been done in the past, but federation is good change.  It will make your life and the lives of your customers and partners much easier.  Federation will give you rapid, seamless access to critical applications and websites--without having to step over that pack of tired old dogs:  many logins, passwords, and multi-factor authentications--just to access websites and applications that everyone needs to start their work.  

We want to help you transition to federation! Please send any and all questions to: fpki@gsa.gov

## Federation Advantages 
[Use "sustainable"....?]
* Happy users, customers, and partners
* Seamless access to critical websites and applications
* Increases information security and privacy protections 
* Maximizes shared services and reuse of existing IT infrastructure
* Significantly reduces costs for new IT infrastructure
* Significantly reduces costs for internal identity and access services


## Things To Consider
Is Federation right for my agency? Your answers to these questions may help you to decide: 

* How many externally facing websites and mission-critical applications we own?
* How big is our customer population?
* What funding is available for single sign-on/federated sign-on IT improvements?<!--New IT modernization funding available, per OMB at ICAM Day-->
* Are internal IT funding sources available?
* What are the potential risks?
* Are our stakeholders likely to agree with this bold move? 

These **key actions** will help you to plan for a federation project:  

## <span style="color: #0C5C89">**Federation Project Checklist**</span>

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Create an agency Tiger Team/Working Group to determine whether federation will benefit your agency**

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Direct the agency Tiger Team/Working Group to create a business case for federation**
* Include in the business case:
> Document the "as-is" and "to-be" (optimized) states of targeted processes
> Identify targeted websites/applications
> Estimate the potential costs
> Identify funding sources
> Identify the potential risks
* Identify stakeholders and obtain preliminary approval<!--FICAM Roadmap list of Stakeholders is voluminous. How does PM identify which stakeholders must approve?-->
* Obtain CIO, CISO, and CFO approval to proceed with your agency's federation project

Once you get a green light:

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Identify an agency architecture team to propose a federation solution**
* Identify architecture team members
* Develop a proposed federation solution:
> Count the agency's targeted websites and mission-critical applications
> Determine what existing IT infrastructure can be reused
> Determine what new IT needs to be added
> Develop a potentially viable solution

With the proposed solution in hand:

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Work with agency budget team to estimate total cost and calculate the ROI benefit**
* Estimate application integration costs (**Note:**&nbsp;&nbsp;lower to higher application complexity will affect cost)
* Estimate the costs to modify each application's authentication method
* Estimate ongoing, life-cycle costs (service provider/federation broker charges, operations, maintenance)<!--Explain federation broker for PM audience-->

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**If ROI looks promising, identify potential sources of funding**
* Step 1
* Step 2

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Obtain preliminary, key stakeholder buy-in**
<!--FICAM Roadmap list of stakeholders is voluminous.  How does PM know which stakeholders must approve?-->

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Present federation solution, projected costs, ROI, and potential sources of funding to management (CIO/CISO/CFO) for approval to proceed**<!--CIO/CISO/CFO approve?-->

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**With agency approval, obtain final stakeholder buy-in**<!--CIO/CISO approve?-->

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Establish federation project technical implementation team**
* Identify technical implementation team members

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Develop a federation project life-cycle schedule with major milestones** 
* Develop a phased project schedule with incremental milestones, including applications integration/acquisition

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Evaluate and select federation broker or service providers (IdPs)**
<**Add link to xx document [link] for guidance on evaluating**> 

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Enter into Service-Level Agreements (SLAs)**

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Develop federation project management core documents:**
* Project Management Plan (with Work Breakdown Structure and Milestones)

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Determine required reporting and create schedule**
