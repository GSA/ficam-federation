- Audience: Program Managers (single coordination points for managing operations)
- Define the project management steps for planning a Federation project 
- Intro to the Plan section - review, modify and apply plain language principles including less words / more actionable items; focus on steps for a program manager to plan for a single sign on or federated sign on model for a federal enterprise or a federal mission application
- Relying Party Doc Section 5.1 (Page 21) has some materials for this planning.

===============================

Itâ€™s true that federation is a real change in the way things have been done in the past, but federation is good change.  It will make your life and the lives of your customers and partners much easier.  Federation will give you rapid, seamless access to critical applications and websites--without having to step over that pack of tired old dogs:  many logins, passwords, and multi-factor authentications--just to access websites and applications that your customers, partners, and agency users need to start their work.  

We want to help you transition to federation! Please send any and all questions to: fpki@gsa.gov

## Federation Advantages 
[Use "sustainable"....?]

* Seamless access to critical websites and applications
* Strengthens information security and privacy protections 
* Maximizes shared services and reuse of existing IT infrastructure
* Significantly reduces costs for new IT infrastructure
* Significately reduces costs for internal identity and access services
* Happy users, partners, and customers


## Things To Consider
Is federation right for your agency?  Here are a few things to consider:

* How many externally facing websites and mission-critical applications does my agency own?<!--Are the agency websites always the location for accessing mission-critical systems?  Are mission-critical applications both internal and external?-->
* How big is our customer population?
* Is internal funding available for single sign-on/federated sign-on, IT improvements?
* Are additional funding sources available?
* What are the potential risks?
* Are our stakeholders likely to agree with this bold move? 

Here are **key actions** to help you begin planning for a federation project:  

## <span style="color: #0C5C89">**Federation Project Checklist**</span>

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Create a Tiger Team/Working Group to determine whether federation will benefit your agency**

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Direct Tiger Team/Working Group to create a business case**
* Create a business case:
> Current and optimized state of targeted processes
> Identify targeted websites/applications
> Estimate the potential costs
> Identify funding sources
> Identify the potential risks
* Identify stakeholders and obtain preliminary approval
* Obtain CIO, CISO, and CFO approval to proceed with your agency's federation project

Once you get a green light:

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Identify an architecture team to propose a federation solution**
* Identify archtecture team members
* Develop a proposed federation solution:
> Count the targeted websites and mission-critical applications<br>
> Determine what existing IT infrastructure can be reused<br>
> Determine whether new IT needs to be added and what<br>
> Develop a protentially viable solution<br>

With the proposed solution in hand:

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Work with budget team to estimate total cost and calculate the ROI benefit**
* Estimate application integration costs (**Note:**&nbsp;&nbsp;lower to higher application complexity will affect cost)
* Estimate the costs to modify each application's authentication method
* Estimate ongoing, life-cycle costs (federation broker charges, operations, maintenance)

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**If ROI looks promising, identify potential sources of funding**
* Step 1
* Step 2
* Step 3

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Obtain preliminary, key stakeholder buy-in**

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Present federation solution, projected costs, ROI, and potential sources of funding to management for approval to proceed**<!--CIO/CISO/CFO approve?-->

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**With agency approval, obtain final stakeholder buy-in**<!--CIO/CISO approve?-->

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**After stakeholder are on board, management approves the project**

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Establish federation technical implementation team**
* Identify technical implementation team members

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Develop a project life-cycle schedule with milestones** 
* Develop a phased project schedule with incremental milestones, including applications integration/acquisition

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Evaluate and select service providers (IdPs)**
<**Add link to xx document [link] for guidance on evaluating**> 

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Enter into Sevice-Level Agreements (SLAs)**

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Develop project management core documents:**
