===============================

It’s true that Federation is a real shift in the way we’ve done in the past, but Federation is good change.  It will not only make your life easier but also those of your customers.  Federation will give you rapid, streamlined access to critical applications and websites--without having to step over that pack of tired dogs:  many logins, passwords, and multi-factor authentications--just to access applications and websites you need to start your work.  

We want to help your agency transition to Federation! We are available to answer any and all of your questions: fpki@gsa.gov

## Federation Advantages 

* Single Sign-on (SS)/Federated Sign-on (FSO) gives you nearly seamless acess to critical applications and websites
* Happy users, partners, and customers
* Significant cost reductions for IT infrastructure
* Significate cost reductions for internal identity and access services

## Things To Consider
How do I know if Federation is right for my agency?  Fully achieving these advantages may depend on:

* How many externally facing websites does your agency own?
* How many mission-critical agency applications and websites?
* Funding sources and budget
* Stakeholder buy-in

To start planning a Federation project, here are concrete actions you can take: 

## <span style="color: #0C5C89">**Federation Project Checklist**</span>

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Establish a Working Group/Tiger Team To Assess Federation for your Agency**
* Assess your agency's mission and the benefits of Federation
* Assess business needs
* Assess customer interface processes
* Identify targeted applications
* Document the potential costs
* Create a business case
* Obtain preliminary stakeholder buy-in

After the WG/TT concludes its assessment and you get the green light:

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Develop a Proposed Federation Solution**
* Identify an architecture team
* Direct the architecture team to develop a proposed solution:
> Count the targeted applications<br>
> Determine what existing infrastructure can be reused<br>
> Determine what new IT needs to be added<br>
> Study the options<br>
> Develop the solution<br>

With a proposed solution in hand:

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Estimate the Cost**
* Estimate targeted application integration costs (**Note:**&nbsp;&nbsp;lower to higher application complexity will affect cost)
* Estimate the cost to modify each application's authentication method
* Estimate ongoing, life-cycle costs
> Ongoing service charges (e.g., for Service Providers--federation brokers, etc.)<br>
> Operations cost<br>
> Maintenance cost
