- Audience: Program Managers (single coordination points for managing operations)
- Define the project management steps for planning a Federation project 
- Intro to the Plan section - review, modify and apply plain language principles including less words / more actionable items; focus on steps for a program manager to plan for a single sign on or federated sign on model for a federal enterprise or a federal mission application
- Relying Party Doc Section 5.1 (Page 21) has some materials for this planning.

===============================

Itâ€™s true that federation is a real change in the way things have been done in the past, but federation is good change.  It will not only make your life easier but also those of your customers.  Federation will give you rapid, streamlined access to critical applications and websites--without having to step over that pack of tired old dogs:  many logins, passwords, and multi-factor authentications--just to access applications and websites you need to start your work.  

We want to help you transition to Federation. Please send any and all questions to: fpki@gsa.gov

## Federation Advantages 

* Single Sign-on (SS)/Federated Sign-on (FSO) will give you nearly seamless access to critical applications and websites
* Happy users, partners, and customers
* Significate cost reductions for internal identity and access services
* Significant cost reductions for IT infrastructure


## Things To Consider
How do I know if federation is right for my agency?  Consider:

* How many externally facing websites does your agency have? 
* How many mission-critical agency applications do you own?
* Does my agency already have additional funding for HSPD-12 and ICAM improvements?
* Are there other additional funding sources available?
* Will our stakeholders readily agree with this bold move? 

Here are **key actions** to help you begin planning for a federation project:  

## <span style="color: #0C5C89">**Federation Project Checklist**</span>

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Create a Tiger Team/Working Group to determine whether federation will benefit your agency**

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Direct Tiger Team/Working Group to create a business case**
* Create a business case:
> Current and optimized state of targeted processes
> Identify targeted websites/applications
> Estimate the potential costs and funding sources
* Obtain preliminary stakeholder buy-in

Once you get a green light to proceed:

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Identify an Architecture Team to propose a federation solution**
> Count the targeted applications<br>
> Determine what existing infrastructure can be reused<br>
> Determine what new IT needs to be added<br>
> Study the options<br>
> Develop the solution<br>

With the proposed solution in hand:

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Estimate total cost and calculate the ROI benefit**
* Estimate application integration costs (**Note:**&nbsp;&nbsp;lower to higher application complexity will affect cost)
* Estimate the costs to modify each application's authentication method
* Estimate ongoing, life-cycle costs (federation broker charges, operations, maintenance)

"ROI looks good and management approves moving ahead":

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Obtain committed stakeholder buy-in**
