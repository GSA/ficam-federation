- Audience: Program Managers (single coordination points for managing operations)
- Define the project management steps for planning a Federation project 
- Intro to the Plan section - review, modify and apply plain language principles including less words / more actionable items; focus on steps for a program manager to plan for a single sign on or federated sign on model for a federal enterprise or a federal mission application
- Relying Party Doc Section 5.1 (Page 21) has some materials for this planning.
- (2/5/2018) Possible Single Sign-on Referenced Document: _Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management Trust Framework Solutions Functional Requirements for FICAM SAML 2.0 Web Browser SSO Profile v1.0.2_ (Version 1.0.0) (date: 3/11/2014?) (doc undated)
- **One definition of SSO:** http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/single-sign-on Single sign-on (SSO) is a session and user authentication service that permits a user to use one set of login credentials (e.g., name and password) to access multiple applications. The service authenticates the ...user for all the applications he/she has been given rights to and eliminates further prompts when the user switches applications during the same session. On the back end, SSO [allows for] logging user activities as well as monitoring user accounts.   **Do we need to explain SSO/FSO for PM?  Is this covered in another section of playbook?**

Now that you're learned what Federation is, you may be asking yourself: "Is Federation right for our agency? It's a real shift from the way we've done things in the past. What are the advantages of Single Sign-on (SS)/Federated Sign-on (FSO) and third-party credentials? Which other agencies are using Federation? Are there a down side?

Federation offers significant advantages to federal agencies, but it's important to weigh the pros and cons based on your agency's needs:
* Agency mission
* The level of your agency's interface with customers (few to many externally facing applications, few to many customers)
* Benefits of streamlined (simplified) access to applications across government
* The benefits of reducing operational costs and credentialing infrastructure through Single Sign-on (SSO)/Federated Sign-on (FSO) and third-party credentialing services (--SSO, identity proofing, maintaining attribute repositories, and issuing/revoking credentials)
* Increased productivity through reduced user authentication needs (many logins, mulitiple credentials for many applications)
* Reduced labor cost for technical support teams
* Finding funding sources for Federation projects
* Stakeholder buy-in
* What are the inherent risks? 
* What federal reporting changes would be required with a Federation model (e.g., FISMA)?
* Compliance with Executive Orders, directives, policies, and standards

Once you've considered the pros and cons and think Federation would benefit your agency, how do you plan for a Federation project?" 

The key planning tasks would include: (See the checklists below for actionable steps)
* Agency mission, business needs, and customer-interface processes. 
* What are the requirements for the Federation project?
* What federal policies and mandates apply to Federation projects? -- policies, OMB memoranda, FISMA requirements, NIST standards, initatives to ensure compliance
* Cost-benefit analysis for accepting third-party credentials [ORIG: business cases]
* Develop a business case(s)
* How to obtain funding and from where
* Identify, communicate with, and get feedback from stakeholders about the Federation project.  [Does this apply: ICAM Segment government-wide and agency-level stakeholders in Roadmap, pgs. 168-175]
* How to evaluate and contract with Service Providers
* How to manage, mitigate, and report risks and issues -- internal agency, across-agency, cross-government?
* What federal reporting is required?
* Develop communications and outreach vehicles - foster communications and cooperation, consistent messaging, timely and accurate reporting [Roadmap, pg. 178)

## What Do We Need To Do?
You can begin achieving the benefits of Federation by taking the following steps:

## <span style="color: #0C5C89">**Checklist**</span>

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Create a Business Case**
* To build a business case, you'll need to document the costs and benefits of accepting third-party credentials.
* And then what do they do?  **Is there a business case development reference doc?--From FICAM Roadmap, section 4, "ICAM Use Cases"??

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Estimate upfront costs to plan, design, build, and maintain Federation solution?** 
* Count your agency's applications that need to accept third-party credentials.
* Determine what existing infrastructure can be reused.
* What new infrastructure needs to be put in place?
* What will your Federation solution cost to plan, design, build, and maintain?

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Estimate application integration costs.**
* Calculate the cost based on the **integration?** effort per application.
* Assess how complex is the application
* Assess how easily can the application authentication method can be modified **Existing system or new system?**
* Assess how easy it is to link third-party credentials to RP accounts. **Is this Account Linking?**

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Estimate ongoing, life-cycle costs.**
* Plan 
* Design
* Build/Integrate
* Operate/Manage/Overhead
* Governance
* Maintain
* Service charges (for example, if you use a shared service provider, such as a federation broker, then you would also calculate ongoing service charges.) 

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Calculate ROI benefit.** 
* After the costs have been estimated, calculate the Return on Investment (ROI) gained by reducing your cost for identity-proofing and managing credentials. 
* Weigh the benefits vs. cost. 

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Identify and Obtain Funding.**
**What are steps?**

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Evaluate and Select IdP(s).**
* Evaluate - Review xx document [link] for guidance on evaluating IdPs.
* Select - Reivew xx document [link] for guidance on selecting IdPs.

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**XXX Sevice-Level Agreements (SLAs).**
* Enter into SLAs with IdPs. Review xx document [link] for guidance on executing SLAs. [**agency-specific?**]

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Establish Federation Project Schedule.** 
* Prioritize incremental project tasks and achievable milestones (Agile - iterations) 
* Phase A: Target business case systems
* Phase B: xxxx
* Phase C: xxx
* Phase D: xxx

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Establish Federation project schedule.** 
* Communicate with stakeholders and users to determine their requirements and buy-in, since third-party credentials is a significate change in traditional reliance on federally-issued credentials.
* Develop a Federation project schedule (phases and achievable, incremental milestones).

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Develop Program Management core documents:**
* Project Management Plan
* Project Schedule and Milestones
* Risk Management Plan
* Communications Plan?

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Determine what reporting is required**
* Project Status Reviews and Reports to agency CIO*?*
* Budget vs. actuals reporting
* FISMA reporting
* Senior Agency Officials for Privacy reporting*?*


Additional planning:
* Establish working group(s)?
* Define workstreams for project and administrative [Roadmap, pg. 177]
