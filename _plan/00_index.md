- Audience: Program Managers (single coordination points for managing operations)
- Define the project management steps for planning a Federation project 
- Intro to the Plan section - review, modify and apply plain language principles including less words / more actionable items; focus on steps for a program manager to plan for a single sign on or federated sign on model for a federal enterprise or a federal mission application
- Relying Party Doc Section 5.1 (Page 21) has some materials for this planning.
- (2/5/2018) Possible Single Sign-on Referenced Document: _Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management Trust Framework Solutions Functional Requirements for FICAM SAML 2.0 Web Browser SSO Profile v1.0.2_ (Version 1.0.0) (date: 3/11/2014?) (doc undated)
- **One definition of SSO:** http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/single-sign-on Single sign-on (SSO) is a session and user authentication service that permits a user to use one set of login credentials (e.g., name and password) to access multiple applications. The service authenticates the ...user for all the applications he/she has been given rights to and eliminates further prompts when the user switches applications during the same session. On the back end, SSO [allows for] logging user activities as well as monitoring user accounts.   **Do we need to explain SSO/FSO for PM?  Is this covered in another section of playbook?**

===============================

It’s true that Federation is a real shift in the way we’ve done in the past, but let's open up some windows and let the fresh air in.  Federation is good change.  It will make your life easier and those of your customers.  Federation will give you and your customers rapid, streamlined access to critical applications and websites--without having to step over that pack of tired old dogs:  many logins, passwords, and multi-factor authentications--just to get to applications or websites you need to start your work.  Once your agency is federated, you may well ask, “why didn’t we do this before?”

We want to help you and your agency make the transition to Federation. Please email any and all questions to us at: fpki@gsa.gov!<!--Is this the right email address? Should it be "federation@gsa.gov"?-->

## Federation Advantages 

* Single Sign-on (SS)/Federated Sign-on (FSO) gives you nearly seamless acess to critical applications and websites
* Happy users and customers
* Increased collaboration across agencies and with partners
* Significant cost reductions for IT infrastructure
* Significate cost reductions in internal identity and access services

## Transition to Federation -- Things To Consider:

* How extensive is your interface with your customers (e.g., many externally facing websites)?
* How many mission-critical agency applications does your agency own?
* Budget and funding sources
* Size of your stakeholder community
* Policy compliance
* Reporting requirements

If Federation looks like it would benefit your agency, the next step is to [target and] plan for a Federation project. 

## Plan for a Federation Project

To help you plan, here are some key steps and actions you can take: 

## <span style="color: #0C5C89">**Federation Project Checklist**</span>

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Assess Agency mission, business needs, and customer-interface processes.**
* Step?
* Step?

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Create a Business Case**
* To build a business case, you'll need to document the costs and benefits of SSO/FSO and accepting third-party credentials.
* Add a link to **business case development how-to reference?--Maybe from FICAM Roadmap, section 4, "ICAM Use Cases"??**

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Estimate upfront costs to plan, design, and build the Federation solution** 
* Estimate the cost of moving to SSO/FSO and third-party credentials 
* Count the agency's applications that need to accept third-party credentials
* Determine what existing infrastructure can be reused
* Determine what new IT infrastructure needs to be put in place
* Estimate the total upfront costs for all project phases

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Estimate application integration costs.** **Isn't this part of Build (in previous checklist item)**
* Estimate the cost to integrate the solution for target applications (**Note:**&nbsp;&nbsp;lower to higher application complexity will affect cost)
* Estimate the cost to modify each existing application's authentication method
* Estimate the cost to link third-party credentials to Relying Party accounts

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Estimate ongoing, life-cycle costs.**
* Include Service charges (e.g., for SPs, such as a federation brokers, also calculate ongoing service charges) 

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Calculate ROI benefit.** 
* After the costs have been estimated, calculate the Return on Investment (ROI).
* **Is there a weigh to calculate the possible cost reduction over time?**
* Weigh the benefits vs. cost. 

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Identify and Obtain Funding**
**What are steps?**

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Otain Stakeholder Buy-in**
