- Audience: Program Managers (single coordination points for managing operations)
- Define the project management steps for planning a Federation project 
- Intro to the Plan section - review, modify and apply plain language principles including less words / more actionable items; focus on steps for a program manager to plan for a single sign on or federated sign on model for a federal enterprise or a federal mission application
- Relying Party Doc Section 5.1 (Page 21) has some materials for this planning.
- Numbers of users that visit agency-specific websites and use their application(s):  [Analytics.usa.gov](https://analytics.usa.gov/){:target="_blank}

===============================

Itâ€™s true that federation is a real change in the way things have been done in the past, but federation is good change. It will make your life and those of your customers and partners much easier.  Federation will give you rapid, seamless access to critical websites and applications--without having to step over that pack of tired old dogs:  many logins, passwords, and multi-factor authentications--just to access websites and applications that everyone needs to start their work.  

You may be thinking, "well, that all sounds good in theory, but is federation right for my agency's business needs?"  

## Consider the Federation Advantages 
[Use "sustainable"....?]
* Seamless access to critical websites and applications (happy users, customers, and partners)
* Significantly reduced costs for IT infrastructure through increased shared services and reuse
* Significantly reduced costs for internal identity and access services
* Increased privacy protections
* Increased information security

## What Are Your Business Needs? 

Federation is an optimal solution for agencies with large customer bases and many externally facing websites. Consider:

* Number of agency externally facing websites and mission-critical applications
* Size of customer population<!--Most visited Federal Government websites:  https://analytics.usa.gov/-->
* Likelihood that your stakeholders will agree with this bold move 

Does federation sound like a win-win for your agency? Here are **key steps** you can take to start a federation project:

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Direct the agency Tiger Team/Working Group to create a business case**
* Include in the business case:
> Document the "as-is" and "to-be" (optimized) states of targeted processes
> Identify targeted websites/applications
> Estimate the potential costs
> Identify funding sources<!--e.g., Technology Modernization Fund established by the Modernizing Government Technology Act-->

* Identify stakeholders<!--FICAM Roadmap list of Stakeholders is voluminous. How does PM identify which stakeholders must approve?-->

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Identify agency architecture team to propose a federation solution**
* Identify architecture team members
* Develop a proposed federation solution:<br>
> Count the agency's targeted websites and mission-critical applications<br>

> Determine what new IT needs to be added<br>
> Develop a potentially viable solution<br>

With the proposed solution in hand:

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Work with agency budget team to estimate the cost and calculate ROI**
* Estimate application integration costs (**Note:**&nbsp;&nbsp;lower to higher application complexity will affect cost)
* Estimate the costs to modify each application's authentication method
* Estimate ongoing, life-cycle costs (service provider/federation broker charges, operations, maintenance)<!--Explain federation broker for PM audience.  Are we suggesting that a solution might be MAX.gov or Login.gov?-->

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Identify project costs and potential funding sources**
* Calculate projected costs
* Identify potential IT modernization funding sources. Some sources may be: 
> Optional working capital funds within your agency that enable long-term savings for big projects.<br>
