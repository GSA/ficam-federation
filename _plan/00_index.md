- Audience: Program Managers (single coordination points for managing operations)
- Define the project management steps for planning a Federation project 
- Intro to the Plan section - review, modify and apply plain language principles including less words / more actionable items; focus on steps for a program manager to plan for a single sign on or federated sign on model for a federal enterprise or a federal mission application
- Relying Party Doc Section 5.1 (Page 21) has some materials for this planning.
- (2/5/2018) Possible Single Sign-on Referenced Document: _Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management Trust Framework Solutions Functional Requirements for FICAM SAML 2.0 Web Browser SSO Profile v1.0.2_ (Version 1.0.0) (date: 3/11/2014?) (doc undated)
- **One definition of SSO:** http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/single-sign-on Single sign-on (SSO) is a session and user authentication service that permits a user to use one set of login credentials (e.g., name and password) to access multiple applications. The service authenticates the ...user for all the applications he/she has been given rights to and eliminates further prompts when the user switches applications during the same session. On the back end, SSO [allows for] logging user activities as well as monitoring user accounts.   **Do we need to explain SSO/FSO for PM?  Is this covered in another section of playbook?**

===============================

Now that you're learned what Federation is, you may be asking yourself: 
* Is Federation right for our agency? (It's a real shift from the way we've done things in the past.) 
* What are the advantages of Single Sign-on (SS)/Federated Sign-on (FSO) and third-party credentials? 
* Which other agencies are using Federation? 
* Is there a down side?

## Pros and Cons of Federation

Federation offers significant advantages to federal agencies, but it's important to weigh the pros and cons based on your agency's needs:
* Agency mission
* The level of your agency's interface with customers (few to many externally facing applications, few to many customers)
* Benefits of streamlined (simplified) access to applications across government by increased productivity through reduced user authentication needs (many logins, mulitiple credentials for many applications)
* The benefits of reducing operational costs and credentialing infrastructure through Single Sign-on (SSO)/Federated Sign-on (FSO) and third-party credentialing services (--SSO, identity proofing, maintaining attribute repositories, and issuing/revoking credentials)
* Reduced labor cost for technical support teams
* Availability of funding
* Stakeholder buy-in
* What are the inherent risks? 
* Compliance with Executive Orders, directives, policies, and standards
* What federal reporting is required(e.g., FISMA)?

If, after considering the pros and cons, does Federation look like it would benefit your agency? ...and you would like to start ....  you'll think about planning your Federation project.

## How Do I Plan a Federation Project?

Intro statement:  xxxxxx 

Key planning tasks: (**Note:**&nbsp;&nbsp;See the checklists below for actionable steps)

* Estimate upfront costs and application integration cost **application = what?**
* Cost-benefit analysis with ROI
* Draft requirements for agency and stakeholder review
* Identify funding sources
* Communicate and collaborate with stakeholders
* Evaluate and select Service Providers (IdPs)
* Enter into Service-Level Agreements (SLAs)
* Manage and mitigate risks
* What federal reporting is required?
* What federal mandates and policies apply?
* Develop communications and outreach vehicles - foster communications and cooperation, consistent messaging, timely and accurate reporting [Roadmap, pg. 178)

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Assess Agency mission, business needs, and customer-interface processes.**
* Step?
* Step?

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Create a Business Case**
* To build a business case, you'll need to document the costs and benefits of accepting third-party credentials.
* And then what do they do?  **Is there a business case development reference doc?--From FICAM Roadmap, section 4, "ICAM Use Cases"??

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Estimate upfront costs to plan, design, and build the Federation solution?** 
* Estimate the cost of moving to SSO/FSO and third-party credentials 
* Count the agency's applications that need to accept third-party credentials
* Determine what existing infrastructure can be reused
* Determine what new infrastructure needs to be put in place
* Estimate the total upfront costs for all project phases

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Estimate application integration costs.** **Isn't this part of Build (in previous checklist item)**
* Estimate the cost to integrate the solution for all applications (**Note:**&nbsp;&nbsp;lower to higher application complexity will affect cost)
* Estimate the cost to modify each exsting application's authentication method
* Estimate the cost to link third-party credentials to Relying Party accounts

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Estimate ongoing, life-cycle costs.**
* Include Service charges (e.g., for SPs, such as a federation brokers, also calculate ongoing service charges) 

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Calculate ROI benefit.** 
* After the costs have been estimated, calculate the Return on Investment (ROI) gained by reducing your cost for identity-proofing and managing credentials. 
* Weigh the benefits vs. cost. 

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Identify and Obtain Funding.**
**What are steps?**

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Evaluate and Select Service Providers (IdPs).**
* Evaluate - Review xx document [link] for guidance on evaluating IdPs.
* Select - Reivew xx document [link] for guidance on selecting IdPs.

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Enter into Sevice-Level Agreements (SLAs).**
* Enter into SLAs with IdPs. Review xx document [link] for guidance on executing SLAs. [**agency-specific?**]

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Establish a Federation project schedule.** 
* Target business case applications
* Communicate with stakeholders and users to determine their requirements and buy-in.
* Develop a phased, Federation project schedule with incremental milestones.

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Develop project management core documents:**
* Project Management Plan (with Work Breakdown Structure)
* Project Schedule and Milestones
* Risk Management Plan
* Communications Plan

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Timely and accurate reporting**
* Project Status Reviews and Reports to agency CIO*?*
* Budget vs. actuals reporting
* FISMA reporting
* Senior Agency Officials for Privacy reporting*?*


Additional planning:
* Establish stakeholders working group(s)/tiger team
